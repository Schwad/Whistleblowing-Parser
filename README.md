# Whistleblowing-Parser
In June 2015, Montana deleted all of its checkbook data, reuploading it 10 days later. This script compares an old backup JSON file to the new data to generate fraudulent data-altering reports.

Old data available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/llzbpz4gyrrf9m3/rows.json?dl=0).

New data available [here](https://data.datamontana.us/Financial/Montana-s-Checkbook-Accounts-Payable-Payments/d7uw-2snd).
